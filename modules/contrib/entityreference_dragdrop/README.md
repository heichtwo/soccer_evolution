# Entity Reference Drag & Drop

The Entity Reference Drag & Drop module allows the user to select
an entity to reference using two side-by-side lists. User selects
entities from the left-hand list and moves them to the right-hand
list. The entities can also be re-arranged (stored in the field
delta) by dragging them around.
